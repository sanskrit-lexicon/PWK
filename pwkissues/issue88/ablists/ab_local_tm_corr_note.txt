Here is the corrected file of the local abbreviations. Please have a look.
I also corrected  more typing errors than I would have expected to find. My theory is that one of the reasons is that people were typing pw from an Indian reprint and not from a scan of the original Boehtlingk in our institute library. That came only  later. The second reason could be a correction procedure which we replaced later on. So I have some sympathy for the frequent moaning of AB and also want to atone for these shortcomings by getting engaged in the further correction process of pw. Maybe you have some ideas about what can be done. 

I  have mostly not  gone through the <ab n='unter' or 'und', because they are somewhat tricky to correct. I would want to treat them separately.

Note that some entries have a commentaries after the entry number.
