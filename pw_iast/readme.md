### pw_iast
This pw_iast section is intended to foster contributions to corrections of suspicious
IAST spellings in PWK dictionary.
See this [Sanskrit-lexicon correction issue](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/419) for further context.


#### pwis_notmw3_correctionform.txt
Interested parties should enter corrections in this file, as follows.

Fill in the 'Correction_SLP1=' field for any of the 1500+ cases.
Note the expected spelling is in SLP1 form; this was chosen as the
easiest to deal with in the context of the suggestions, which are spelled
using SLP1 transliteration.

When the corrections are installed in the PWK digitization, these SLP1
corrections will be used to change the IAST spellings which appear as
the first word in each case.

#### Cases with no change required
There may be cases where the given spelling is correct.
In such cases, enter the correction as the specific string 'OK'.

#### links to context

For many cases, it will be necessary to refer to the context in which
the suspicious spelling occurs.


The [pwis_notmw.html](https://sanskrit-lexicon.github.io/PWK/pwis_notmw.html) file has been prepared to help.
The lines of this html file correspond to the cases.
For each case, there is a link to the headword(s) of the PWK dictionary where 
 the IAST spelling occurs.
